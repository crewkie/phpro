PhpRo Tools
=======================

Introduction
------------
These are various tools that streamline RO client-side and server-side tasks.

The tools are built in PHP5.x+ (usage of OOP, and namespaces) using the PDO MySQL for any database transactions.

Future Tools
------------
* Ability to, provided you have the .spr/.act/.bmp collection & item files, automatically add an item in-game
  that will add a view ID in lua tables, add to the *num* tables, deposit to a patch file for in-game implementation,
  sync to the database and insert queries. Basically, it'll streamline the entire busy-work of adding a custom
  item in-game.

* Advanced Manipulation of RO client-side files.
* Reading and parsing the GRF showing .act, .spr, and other various files including textures.
* Server-side start/restart tools and commands.
* BrowEdit but in the browser.
* Much, much more.
